After downloading the software, a Windows Forms Application must be made with at least three properly functioning controls. The three controls used were button, checkbox, and combo box.

First, the button that says “A secret message” when pressed displays a pop up containing a message. The pop up is named “Message Box” and the message is “Hello! My name is Angel McDaniel” but this is displayed if the checkbox is left unmarked.

The next control is a checkbox which when selected, changes the buttons message to “Hi!”.

Lastly, the combo box contains colors that change when you select them. When a color is selected, the entire box including the dropdown portion changes into the specified color.
